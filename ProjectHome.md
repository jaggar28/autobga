The AutoBGA program is a GUI for generating footprint data from a screenshot or image captured from the package drawing in the data sheet.

AutoBGA allows CAD designers to produce BGA footprints quickly and reliably from approved drawings. Complex ball patterns and multiple orientations are easily accomodated.

Several output formats are supported:
  * **TSV** (TAB-separated values) list of pad positions and names for spreadsheet import or CAD software packages
  * **XML** list of pad positions and names
  * **EAGLE SCR** script for direct drawing in the EAGLE CAD program
