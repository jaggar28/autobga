# Introduction #
To run AutoBGA from the sources, you need to fulfill the required library dependencies. This is true both under Linux and Windows.

Python 2.5 is required for AutoBGA (may work with 2.4, but untested).

**The main source file to run is "autobga.py".**

# Details #

Library dependencies:
  * Python Imaging Library (PIL) 1.1.6+ (http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/)
  * wxPython 2.8+ (http://www.wxpython.org)
  * Numpy, any version (http://numpy.scipy.org/)

These libraries are all available as one-click Windows Installer or Debian/Ubuntu packages under Linux.
